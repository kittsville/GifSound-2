# GifSound 2

GifSound.com but better

### Better How?

- Syncs gif and sound start time
- No server-side code
- Modular gif/sound plugins (easy to add support for new gif/sound embeds)

### Better Why?

I spend too much time on [/r/GifSound](http://reddit.com/r/gifsound) and found it annoying that gifs sometimes didn't sync to the audio because of gif/YouTube loading times. I was going to contact gifsound.com's creators but I wanted to check if it was possible first. Ended up making my own version from scratch.
