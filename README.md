# GifSound 2

GifSound.com but better

### Better How?

- Syncs gif and sound start time
- No server-side code
- Modular gif/sound plugins (easy to add support for new gif/sound embeds)

### Why?

I spend too much time on [/r/GifSound](http://reddit.com/r/gifsound) and found it annoying that gifs sometimes didn't sync to the audio because of gif/YouTube loading times. I was going to contact gifsound.com's creators but I wanted to check if it was possible first. Ended up making my own version from scratch.

### Roadmap

1. Finish adding basic features and rudimentary media support (add gifv and Giphy support)
2. Contact /r/gifsound mods with aims to gain subscriber feedback
3. Start releasing weekly with minor features each time
4. Add all useful media types (SoundCloud etc.)
5. Switch to more gradual releases and issue/passive contact based development
6. Maintain application as needs be (fix media plugins etc.)
