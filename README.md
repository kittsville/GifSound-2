# GifSound 2  
*Improved gif + sound mashups*

GifSound 2 is an abandoned prototype of a gif/audio syncing web app. It was created in a week to gague the interest of Reddit's [/r/gifsound](http://reddit.com/r/gifsound) community. The moderators weren't interested and my uni holiday ended so I abandoned the project.

It's fallen into disrepair but you could probably get it working with some spit and grease.

### Features (current)

- Syncs gif and sound start time
- No server-side code
- Modular gif/sound plugins (easy to add support for new gif/sound embeds)

### Contributing

Feel free to have a crack at getting this thing working again. If you want to take over the project I can give you the domain `gifsound2.com`.

### Legal

GifSound2.com does not host any of the gifs or sounds that make gifsounds. GifSound2 embeds that content from 3rd parties. If you see a gifsound you don't like then please contact the gif host (Imgur.com, giphy.com, etc.) or the sound host (YouTube.com, SoundCloud.com, etc.) and ask them to take it down. **I cannot take down what I am not hosting**, just as I can't move a parked car that I do not own and did not park.

All gifsounds are the responsibility of their creators.
